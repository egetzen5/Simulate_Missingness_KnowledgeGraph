To get the sequences of medical events, follow the steps from https://github.com/ziyili20/DistributedLearningPredictor. 'data_path' corresponds to the location of these sequences.

Download the knowledge graph 'noisy_mat' from this repository. 'kg_path' corresponds to the location of this graph.

To run the different experiments, edit the main.py file and input different arguments that select the desired experiment.
On the command line, run python main.py
