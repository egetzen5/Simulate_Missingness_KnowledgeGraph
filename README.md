To get the sequences of medical events, follow the steps from https://github.com/ziyili20/DistributedLearningPredictor. 'data_path' corresponds to the location of these sequences.

If you need the knowledge graph, reach out to me at egetzen@upenn.edu. The file was too big for github and I will need to send separately. 'kg_path' corresponds to the location of this graph.

To run the different experiments, edit the main.py file with your desired arguments!
